    text: "CRISPR-3D lets you see the molecular world in the palm of your hand! All based on real scientific data, these 3D protein models showcase the diversity of CRISPR. Microbes use CRISPR-Cas immune systems to fend off viral attack, and now you can examine these molecular machines up-close. Place CRISPR-Cas models on any flat surface through your device camera. Play around with the models and read about the role each one plays in CRISPR immunity."
