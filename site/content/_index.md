        title: SuperStruct
        link: https://playsuperstruct.com
        caption: Collaborating with scientists at UT Austin, we designed and produced this new citizen science game which challenges players to fit 3D models of proteins together to form protein complexes. Players then share their solutions with researchers to collectively find the optimal configuration. Each puzzle represents a different biological mechanism important to human health.

        title: CRISPR-3D
        link: https://innovativegenomics.org/crispr-3d/
        caption: This unique app displays CRISPR protein systems using augmented reality to allow students, educators, and scientists to investigate the 3D structure of these increasingly important but often complex biological mechanisms. The app includes a feature that displays 3D models using custom playing cards designed by the Innovative Genomics Institute.

        title: Eterna
        link: https://eternagame.org
        caption: We work closely with a development team based at Stanford University to manage the design and development of this citizen science game which challenges players to create RNA molecules for medical research by solving Sudoku-like puzzles. The RNAs are synthesized and tested at a lab at Stanford, and the data is returned to players so they can iterate on their own - and each other’s - designs.

        title: Mantra Bio
        link: https://mantrabio.com
        caption: We designed and developed a new website for this biotech startup focused on exosome therapeutics, including an explainer video and a unique design language.

        title: Buck Academy
        link: https://onlinelearning.buckinstitute.org
        caption: We designed and produced this free online course about the biology of aging from the Buck Institute. The web-based course includes video, slideshows, animations, and interactive exercises to engage students in understanding the relationship between aging and disease, as well as information on how to avoid illness as we age.

        title: Phage Invaders
        link: https://innovativegenomics.org/phage-invaders/
        caption: Working closely with UC Berkeley’s Innovative Genomics Institute, we designed and produced this mobile game which teaches kids (and adults!) about CRISPR gene editing. Players defend their bacterial cellular home from invading viral phages by cutting injected viral DNA before it can make more phages.
