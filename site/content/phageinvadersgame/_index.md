    text: "Bacterium is under attack by the ruthless phage viruses! Their goal? To clone their mindless soldiers and destroy other cities like yours. Play as the local hero Cris Perotein and defend Bacterium from the viral invaders by slicing viral DNA before they create more clones. Each level introduces more complexity as you learn about CRISPR proteins and how they fend off real viruses."

         title: "Slice the Viral DNA"
         caption: "Navigate the cell to intercept and slice viral DNA strands before phages are assembled and escape. Once all three parts of a phage are combined, there's nothing that can stop them from escaping the cell and causing damage."

         title: "Match the Guide RNA"
         caption: "Each phage can inject one of four types of DNA. You'll need to keep changing your guide RNA to match the DNA of the invaders, storing the viral DNA in your cell's plasmid to recognize it more quickly."

         title: "Avoid Anti-CRISPRs"
         caption: "Eventually the phages start to fight back: they inject DNA to create anti-CRISPR proteins which stick to you and slow you down. Move to avoid them or risk being overrun by phage clones."

         title: "Last as Long as You Can"
         caption: "In Survival Mode, fight off the phages as they get faster and increase their forces. Share your score on the leaderboard and see how your defense skills stack up against other players around the world!"
