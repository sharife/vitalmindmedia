    heading: Overview
    text: "The city of Bacterium is under attack by the ruthless phage viruses! Their goal? To clone their mindless soldiers and destroy other cells like yours. Play as the local hero Cris Perotein, and  defend Bacterium from the viral invaders by running into and slicing viral DNA as well as discover more and more complications to doing your heroic duty as you learn about CRISPR proteins and how they fend off real viruses."

         title: "Objective"
         caption: "The objective of the game is for the player to run Cris Perotein into viral DNA strands in order to slice them, filling the quota before phages are constructed and escape the cell, causing damage to it in the process. Once all three parts of a phage are combined, there's nothing that can stop them from escaping the cell."

         title: "Acts"
         caption: "As the game progresses, it passes through four acts. Each act introduces a new game mechanic that depicts an aspect of real CRISPR proteins."

         title: "Guide RNA"
         caption: "Once players reach Act 3, they are introduced to guide RNA that they must switch between in order to slice the corresponding color of Phage DNA. Players can switch gRNAs using the four colors on the left side that appear once they reach Act 3."

         title: "Survival Mode"
         caption: "The fifth act, Survival Mode, has all the same game mechanics as Act 4, however instead of trying to fill a quota the player's objective is simply to last as long as they can. Once the cell dies, the score is a combination of how many seconds the player lasted and how many DNA strands they cut."

        title: attune
        caption: We worked with clinical experts and cancer survivors to adapt a validated Cognitive Behavioral Therapy program for anxiety and depression into a self-guided mobile app. The resulting product from Blue Note Therapeutics, attune, received the FDA's breakthrough designation and met its primary endpoint in a randomized controlled trial.

        title: Eterna
        link: https://eternagame.org
        caption: As part of a development team based at Stanford University, we manage the design and development of this citizen science game which challenges players to create RNA molecules for medical research by solving Sudoku-like puzzles. The RNAs are synthesized and tested at a lab at Stanford, and the data is returned to players so they can iterate on their own - and each other’s - designs.

        title: Serein
        caption: Working closely with therapists at Memorial Sloan Kettering, cancer survivors, and Blue Note Therapeutics, we designed a digital intervention for anxiety and depression in advanced cancer patients. Guided by a conversational AI-based character, the game-like experience lets users journey as a bird through a mythical landscape, along with a group of companions, to explore and restore their sense of meaning in life.

        caption: This unique app displays CRISPR protein systems using augmented reality to allow students, educators, and scientists to investigate the 3D structure of these increasingly important but often complex biological mechanisms. The app includes a feature that displays 3D models using custom playing cards designed by the Innovative Genomics Institute.

        title: SuperStruct
        link: https://playsuperstruct.com
        caption: Collaborating with scientists at UT Austin, we designed and produced this prototype science game which challenges players to fit 3D models of proteins together to form protein complexes. Each puzzle represents a different biological mechanism important to human health.

        title: Ansa Bio
        link: https://ansabio.com
        caption: We designed and developed a new website for this biotech startup focused on an innovative enzymatic DNA synthesis technology, including an explainer video and a unique design language.

        title: Phage Invaders
        link: https://innovativegenomics.org/phage-invaders/
        caption: Working closely with UC Berkeley’s Innovative Genomics Institute, we designed and produced this mobile game which teaches kids (and adults!) about CRISPR gene editing. Players defend their bacterial cellular home from invading viral phages by cutting injected viral DNA before it can make more copies of phages.

        title: Buck Academy
        link: https://onlinelearning.buckinstitute.org
        caption: We designed and produced this free online course about the biology of aging from the Buck Institute. The web-based course includes video, slideshows, animations, and interactive exercises to engage students in understanding the relationship between aging and disease, as well as information on how to avoid illness as we age.
